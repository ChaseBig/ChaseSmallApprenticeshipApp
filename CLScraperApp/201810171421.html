</div>
After 6 years and countless miles, it is time to part ways with this unique rig.  The trucks are rare, difficult to find, and in high demand.  It gets looks everywhere I go, and on many occasions people have asked to take photos of it.  <br/>
<br/>
The truck has performed flawlessly for us, never had even a minor issue on long trips, and always starts.  We have done road trips up to 1,000 miles fully loaded with camping gear.  We simply don't drive it enough to really need it anymore.  It runs and drives nicely considering the age and mileage.  I wouldn't hesitate to jump in it and drive it anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Factory Features:<br/>
-Seats for 5 people<br/>
-4 cylinder engine (20 mpg) - was originally a 22rte turbo engine, now a 22re non-turbo<br/>
-R151F 5-speed manual transmission (lowest 1st gear offered; only offered in 1986-1987 turbo pickup trucks)<br/>
-4wd with 23 spline gear driven transfer case (strongest t-case offered)<br/>
-Power steering<br/>
-Air Conditioning (complete but does not blow cold)<br/>
-SR5 gauge cluster (tachometer, oil PSI, alternator, temperature, etc)<br/>
-Manual locking hubs<br/>
-6 foot long bed<br/>
<br/>
Modifications:<br/>
-Slight suspension lift (approximately 1 inch)<br/>
-"Zukmod" rear suspension for heavier loads - approximately 2,000 pound capacity<br/>
-Front bucket seats from 1990 4Runner (lumbar adjustment and tilt headrests)<br/>
-Shoulder harness seatbelts installed in rear (Poison Spyder seat belt bungs)<br/>
-Center console from 2006 Toyota Prius (front and rear cup holders and storage)<br/>
-Aluminum double row radiator<br/>
-Mobi-Arc alternator stator upgrade<br/>
-Front turn signals converted to parking lights (allows for winch bumper)<br/>
-Headlights converted to accept H4 style bulbs (bulb fits in rear of light)<br/>
-Brake master cylinder converted to the larger bore V6<br/>
-Front calipers and rotors converted to larger V6<br/>
-Sony stereo (CD player, mp3 input jack, USB input)<br/>
-Rear tube bumper with 2" receiver hitch<br/>
-Bed aluminum diamond plate tool box with keys<br/>
-Locking gas cap with keys<br/>
-Plastic bed liner<br/>
-16" Toyota T100 wheels<br/>
-Tinted windows (tint is showing the age)<br/>
-Ford side mirrors<br/>
-Rear view mirror with anti-glare lever (this was optional in 1986)<br/>
-Chrome side steps<br/>
-Speakers installed in doors (marine grade water resistant)<br/>
<br/>
Maintenance since I have owned it:<br/>
-Ball joints, tie rod ends, pitman arm, and idler arm replaced.<br/>
-4-wheel alignment<br/>
-Tires balanced<br/>
-Metal tire valve stems<br/>
-Engine front crank seal replaced<br/>
-Water pump replaced<br/>
-Transfer case rear seal replaced<br/>
-Driveshaft carrier bearing replaced<br/>
-Brake fluid change<br/>
-New exhaust tail pipe and radiator<br/>
-Front wheel bearings cleaned and re-greased<br/>
-Front brakes replaced<br/>
-Rear brakes inspected and adjusted<br/>
-Starter rebuilt<br/>
-Transmission fluid<br/>
-Transfer case fluid<br/>
-Rear differential oil<br/>
-Front differential oil<br/>
-New aluminum radiator and hoses<br/>
-Antifreeze change<br/>
-Water pump changed<br/>
-Fan belts changed<br/>
-New clutch master cylinder, slave cylinder, fluid<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The truck is 33 years old and has over 200,000 miles, so there are items that need attention.  Here are the most obvious points in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
-Headliner and b-pillar interior is deteriorating.  It was covered in a soft felt material when the cab modification was done, and the material simply wasn't very durable.<br/>
-Paint clear coat is peeling - unsure if it is worth worrying about<br/>
-Small exhaust leak in the middle section of the exhaust.  Small section of exhaust needs replaced.<br/>
-Power steering fluid has not been changed recently<br/>
-A/C needs a leak fixed and re-charged (possibly convert to R134)<br/>
-The clock in the dash is missing - has been missing since I purchased the truck.  The stereo has a clock, so it really isn't necessary<br/>
-Tires probably have about 10,000 miles remaining and will need replaced within a year or so.<br/>
<br/>
Included is a Haynes repair manual for the truck and a Toyota FACTORY service manual for the R151F transmission (hard to find).  <br/>
<br/>
Since the truck is a 1986, it is now 32 years old and qualifies for collector license plates in Colorado.<br/>
<br/>
Clean title in hand.  Emissions test will be provided for Denver Metro residents.  Sold as-is and where-is.  Cash transaction or cashiers check issued at the counter of your bank.    </section></p>

</div>
Classic 1980 Toyota Pickup.<br/>
<br/>
 Under 140,000 miles. <br/>
<br/>
 20R engine. 4 Speed. Great Low range. Built during oil crisis era when speed limit was 55 mph. Top speed is about 65. Great for hauling things and 4 wheeling<br/>
<br/>
 Would be great farm truck, hunting truck, crawler. Always starts (even at high altitude) and runs well. Timing chain, not a timing belt. Not a lot of things to go wrong. New clutch only has 500 miles on it. Clutch pedal leaks near the floor board and needs the O-rings replaced.<br/>
<br/>
 Oil drips near pan. <br/>
<br/>
 Body is rough with typical Toyota rusting around rear tire wells. Paint is very faded and is not original.<br/>
<br/>
 Tires are good. The windshield is cracked.<br/>
<br/>
 This vehicle has never had an emissions test and may or may not pass. Sold As-is. Would need work to be a daily driver such as new shocks and the clutch pedal 0-rings replaced. <br/>
<br/>
 Serious inquiries only, not interested in trade.    </section></p>

Unfortunately the time has come where I need to get rid of my old school mini truck. It's a 1989 2-wheel drive Toyota short bed with the 22R motor, NOT 22rE, with a 4 speed manual transmission. It's got right at about 196,000 miles on and it runs and drives just fine other than it riding like a tank since I lowered it pretty much as far as possible without getting into airbags and flipping the springs and all that kind of stuff. She isn't the prettiest but gets lots of looks everywhere, especially since it has 4-15's in it and you can hear it coming from about 3 blocks away. The interior is pretty clean and nothing is broken , and since you can't see out the back due to the wall of speakers it has a rear view color camera so you can see where you're going when you're backing up so you don't hit all kinds of stuff. All electrical works, the heater blows hot, there's no cracks in the windshield and it has the bucket seats that they used to sell at checkers a few years back in it with all black carpet in the front and back which is now a walkthrough cab. It has a 5 Channel kicker amp in it for all the mids and highs and a 2-channel Punch monoblock?,.. amp for the subs. It also has a capacitor in it and a Kenwood head unit which is just like all the ones you see at like Best Buy or any kind of box store. I'm asking 3200 for the truck the way it sits, but I'm willing to adjust the price accordingly if you don't want the stereo or certain parts of it. <br/>
If interested please feel free to call me anytime my name is Jeremy and my number is 3oh3-875-600seven. <br/>
Also I'm not looking for any trades at all unless you've got a 2 door  4Runner right around the same year. Other than that thank you for looking, and I hope you have a great day. <br/>

This is a great truck,  new engine with 64k swapped in,  came out of a 2002 3.4L,    I have the whole paper trail and pictures.  Swapped by a shop the whole shabang.<br/>
Body only has 153,xxx on it, I accidentally pushed a pebble into one cylinder changing the plugs on the old engine and it became a 5, so I replaced the motor.  So hey new motor great truck.<br/>
<br/>
Hot Points:<br/>
 - 64k Engine swapped out of a 2002<br/>
 - Lifted on 35" with 12.5in Rims<br/>
 - Custom Tube Front Bumper<br/>
 - Custom Rear bumper with Cool Tire Swing arm<br/>
 - 3/4 Ton Rear Adjustable Airbag Shocks<br/>
<br/>
Professional Stable Lift<br/>
 - 4in Lift<br/>
 - Trail-Gear 4.7 Creeper Gears<br/>
 - Custom rear shocks allow more flex and more stability when stiffened up for the road,  <br/>
 - 4.88 Gears in Both Diffs<br/>
 - Diff Locker in Rear Diff<br/>
<br/>
A lot has been done to it,   I am looking for 5.5k since I just put in 2k for a 64k motor.   Its not a perfect truck, but it runs like a champ.  If you paid 4k for this truck and put a motor in 6k.<br/>

Excellent mechanical condition with 6,000 miles on the tires, brand new front and rear brake pads, and rotors. We are the original owners with all maintenance and repair records dating back to 2003. Maintenance and oil changes were performed according to schedule. The car has always been garaged but there are some minor scratches and dents in the exterior. There have been two very minor fender benders but the car has never been in a serious accident or flood. This has the tow package and a receiving hitch. The only reason we are selling it is because we purchased a larger travel trailer and need a pickup truck to tow the bigger trailer.  Cash only - No dealers please.    </section></p>

This little truck runs smooth and can haul anything.  4 wheel drive makes it great for handling in the mountains and snow and 4 cylinder engine makes it efficient on gas mileage (18miles/gallon in city and 21miles/gallon highway).  Automatic transmission. 220,000miles on engine.<br/>
Looking for cash offers no trades please.    </section></p>

Great sound system with a double din navigation headunit, steel bumpers, swing out tail gate for spare tire (also have the original tailgate with backup camera), 2 10 inch subs with a 500 watt mono amp, 6x9 3 way speakers in the front doors and 6.5" 2 way speakers in the rear doors, 20% tint on all windows, windshield is tinted to 45% with a darker strip on the top.  Flowmaster American thunder exhaust system, and a radar detector that I will include with the sale.  Full list of mods below. . Just put new front rotors and pads on about 1k miles ago, and changed the oil on 10/12.  Rear suspension replaced via recall, which also included new leveling kit at 124k miles.<br/>
<br/>
I also have some original parts I can throw in including the original wheels, tail lights, 3rd brake light, and tailgate with backup cam.  <br/>

Excellent mechanical condition with 6,000 miles on the tires, brand new front and rear brake pads, and rotors.  We are the original owners with all maintenance and repair records dating back to 2003.  Maintenance and oil changes were performed according to schedule.  The car has always been garaged but there are some minor scratches and dents in the exterior.  There have been two very minor fender benders but the car has never been in a serious accident or flood.  This has the tow package and a receiving hitch.  The only reason we are selling it is because we purchased a larger travel trailer and need a pickup truck to tow the bigger trailer.  <br/>

I'm planning on fixing it next week, but if you want to look at it before then let me know.<br/>
Gas mileage is usually ~21/22 mpg.  Tires and brakes are in great condition.  <br/>

I have loved this truck. I bought it last year in Oregon from Toyota dealership as a "certified" used car.  The powertrain warranty is still active on it.  I'm selling it to free up some personal capital and eliminate some debt.  The truck is awesome and works/drives great.<br/>
<br/>
I've copied and pasted the more specific specs (from the dealership where I bought it) to the bottom of this post.<br/>
<br/>
Asking $24k, open to talk about it.  Email me if you'd like to take a look and drive it around.<br/>

I am selling my lovely truck to transition to the van life.  It has some scrapes and very minor dings, but mechanically and functionally, it is perfect and will last forever.  All services on the truck have been done at the Dealership and on schedule.  I have all of the CarFax to show this.<br/>
<br/>
I bought the cap after getting the truck and it cost me about $1,800.  It is in great shape and under 1 year old!  <br/>
<br/>
The build in the back is custom made.  The drawers are strong and roll on skateboard bearings.  Its pretty neat!  The platform fits a full-sized mattress perfectly.  The windows on the cap open for an amazing camping situation.<br/>
<br/>
I have been using this truck on climbing trips for the last year and I have loved it!  It is a perfect little adventure vehicle and I hope it finds a good home.  <br/>
<br/>
The price is pretty firm, due to its value, plus the cap, plus the build and great maintenance record.  You could buy this and take it camping or right on a long road trip that day!  The 4 cylinder motor provides plenty of power and makes for amazing gas mileage.  The 4X4 capabilities will get you where you want to go.    </section></p>

1978 HJ45 with Toyotas H Diesel engine<br/>
Legal import from Australia with clean CO title in my name.<br/>
Right hand drive h41 4 speed<br/>
Toyota PTO winch. Has dual output on T-case if you wanted to run something else off of that. <br/>
Very new 33x12.5 mud tires with new white wheels.<br/>
Suspension has added leafs in the rear for the big storage/ camping thing in the bed.<br/>
recent paint job<br/>
Upgraded headlights (have a set of original if you want to go back)<br/>
4 Huge lights on the front bumper<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if the overall km as the odometer only goes to 5 places<br/>
I don't think it's an too high as it spent most of its life as a fun toy for weekend use according to the guy I got it from and who he bought it from. Can not confirm with certain though. When I got it he had it set up for camping in.<br/>
<br/>
Has AC although it probably needs a recharge as it's not very cold.<br/>
Starts right up after using glow plugs and right away once warmed up.<br/>
CD player with 6 speakers and amp<br/>
New battery last December.<br/>
Toyota floor mat<br/>
Full float rear axle<br/>
long range fuel tank (spans the entire length under the seats) I'm guessing about 30 gal??<br/>
newer clutch and brake master cylinders<br/>
<br/>
Very fun to drive, lots of looks from people for both it being a unique land cruiser but also the right hand drive.<br/>
you don't have to worry about speeding tickets though....<br/>
On I-25 going to work on a flat section it will hold right about 65 MPH, but any hill slows it down big time.<br/>
<br/>
I did an oil change with filter, air filter and fuel filter change using toyota filters from cruiser outfitters along with a radiator flush.<br/>
I have not changed dif, t-case or transmission fluids.<br/>
<br/>
There are multiple websites for parts if that's a concern, just can't have them next day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The bad:<br/>
-Some chipping of the paint on the running boards<br/>
-rust along the connection to the hard top and cab<br/>
- bondo was used in multiple places ( below top corner glass, lower doors, and just below the top above the corner glass<br/>
-mis matched seat coverings( looks like they recovered the bottoms but not the backs<br/>
- radio stays on once key is turned off ( I made a battery disconnect for now)<br/>
- paint looks great from 20' but it does have a few places where it's chipping and a few small scratches.<br/>
-Passed emissions here in Douglas County, but smokes more than I like. Black smoke that is... The pump needs to be adjusted to the altitude. I'm at 6,500'<br/>

Great Truck!! Runs well. Bit of an oil leak but not a huge deal. New radiator and thermostat. Interior is extremely clean as the seats have had a cover on them since it was brand new. Well taken care of and will be sorely missed. Comes with camper shell as well as ladder/kayak racks. 4x4 works perfectly, this truck will go ANYWHERE! No I don't need help selling and only serious offers please. Thanks!    </section></p>

I want to buy a house pretty soon so a few toys need to go.  <br/>
<br/>
Truck (Louie):<br/>
1984 Toyota Pick up with 251,xxx miles.  <br/>
Have service records back to the day it was purchased.<br/>
Recently had the e-brake serviced with new bell cranks.<br/>
Runs and drives great<br/>
I have a new carpet kit that goes with it otherwise the interior is pretty clean.<br/>
Does need a new windshield eventually.  Crack doesn't impair sight line. <br/>
Has the previous generation 6' bed with exterior tie-downs.<br/>
<br/>
Flippac:<br/>
<br/>
Has a few small cracks in the fiberglass that I have covered with flex-seal tape.  I planned on taking it to a boat repair shop to have it repaired, but I just don't have the time.<br/>
Comes with a few Goosegear cabinets for storage.  I used it as a cook top while seated in the truck<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what year this was produced<br/>
Tent could use a good cleaning.<br/>
One screen needs to be replaced<br/>
Both windows slide and rear glass is unbroken and closes properly<br/>
Mattress is comfortable and recently cleaned.<br/>
Unfortunately I don't have the tool to open the Flippac or the clips for the hood to secure it down.  Legs are there and function correctly and the clips could be made easily.<br/>
I stand in the bed and open it with another person standing on the side of the hood to catch it so as not to stress to torsion bar too much.<br/>
Currently it is not permanently attached to the bed because I wasn't sure if I was going to keep it on the Toyota or move it to my other truck.  I would recommend drilling into the bed and use steel brackets to spread out the load on the fiberglass.  I have the steel that will be included. <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you have any questions or would like to come see it.  I own an auto transport company if you are an out of state buyer and would like to have it shipped. I can provide plenty of references in the offroad community.<br/>

Ready to drive across country. I am the second owner. Bought the truck last year. This is a great truck, I drove it to Ohio last spring with no issues at all (it's got under 70,000 miles!). Well cared for truck, religious oil changes, new spark plugs, new water pump. Great tires. The body is rusty in areas (pictured), the frame is solid as are all the suspension components. <br/>

Well loved truck!  We received a company truck and just don't need this one any longer.  It's in great shape with regular service through Stevinson's Toyota Dealership.  Low miles.  Great interior.  Fully loaded with lots of bells and whistles.  Weather Tech floor mats.  This is a "must see"!    </section></p>

One owner 2007 Toyota Tacoma 4WD, 4 door, white, 195,000 miles, automatic. Tires 6 months old, maintained very well. Changed to synthetic oil at 100,000 miles. This is a great truck and I hate to see it go. This truck has many miles to travel yet. No need to sell, I just have to many vehicles. Low ballers--keep looking. I am selling this truck at a price I would pay for it. It is a truck and I have used as such. It has small scratches and the factory paint is flaking off the hood. If I was to keep this truck I would replace the back window, shocks. I am open to offers. Would make a great daily driver or a work truck. Please email for more details. Located near Hampden and Wadsworth. I WILL NOT SHIP    </section></p>

Rare find highly sought after 1995 model. Unfortunately I have to sell this beauty because I am a carpenter and need a pickup truck for work. I have all of the maintenance records. First 90 K miles were in California. Tears in the leather on front seats as shown in photos. Have called leather repair shops and these can easily and affordably be repaired. Also, as shown in the photos, a scratch on the rear bumper from a trash container, which could be buffed out by an autobody shop. Been diligent about using premium gas. Has a lot of life left in it for someone else to love. <br/>
A/C ice cold, <br/>
All scheduled maintenance, <br/>
Looks &amp; drives great, <br/>
Non-smoker, <br/>
Title in hand, <br/>
Upgraded sound system, <br/>
Very clean interior, <br/>
Well maintained<br/>
No accidents<br/>
Will not accept foreign money orders or personal checks.    </section></p>

This has been a daily commuter for years and has recently been replaced with a younger model😂<br/>
<br/>
It runs great. It leaks a lIttle oil but starts and runs easIly EVERYDAY. It has no issues other than cosmetIc clearcoat Issues... The door looking a different color etc, is NOT a different color, it's just clear coat looks faded price by piece.... no rust, good brakes &amp; clutch. Has timing chaIn instead of belt so that never needs servicing. <br/>
<br/>
these are well known to drive 400,000 miles so it's just broken in.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great work truck or daily commuter for anybody. Price is firm.<br/>

1978 Ford F150 Ranger Explorer package with a 351M engine, automatic transmission, cruise control, air conditioning, new paint (original color), color matched spray in bed liner, new windshield, new rear slider and only 81,000 original miles. I bought this truck from the original owners daughter. Her father bought it new from Phil Long Ford in Colorado Springs. <br/>
The 40 year old paint was fading on the roof and the hood so I repainted to original Ford color #7. Very nice! Ready to drive anywhere. $10,000.00<br/>

2000 Toyota Tundra 4X4 pickup for sale. Truck has 406,XXX miles (daily driver), almost new tires, new timing belt, water pump, tensioner etc. new radiator (replaced with timing belt), etc. Truck runs and drives strong and smooth like new, very reliable, if you know these trucks you know this is not uncommon. I feel as though the engine may have been rebuilt at some point because of how good it runs. It does have some signs of wear on the body and interior, no major dents or holes. Please call me for an appointment and I will be glad to show the truck. It does have a body color matching topper but the windows aren't secure.<br/>
<br/>

Immaculate, One of a Kind, My loss your gain, Hurry fast, Blah Blah... I could say all the cheesy phrases to gather interest for my truck but there is no need.  If your a truck guy or gal and/or a Tundra fan you will know its a good pickup right away.  You get what you pay for, and you will get your money's worth here.<br/>
<br/>
2011 Toyota Tundra Platinum 5.7L CrewMax 4WD --- 30,000 Miles <br/>
<br/>
Has every option you could possibly get on this truck plus some.  I have had many different Tundras, and I am personally a fan of this body style vs the new for a few reasons but the back seat and overall layout/design are my favorite.<br/>
<br/>
Extras:<br/>
- Bilstein 5100 shocks front and back, the front are ride height adjustable and currently on the middle setting <br/>
  which gives the front about a 1.5 inch lift without causing ride change or alignment stress.  I also have original <br/>
  shocks which will be included.<br/>
- Diamondback HD Truck Cover<br/>
- NFab Side Steps<br/>
- LT285/60/20 Goodyear Duratracs with 11/32 tread (over $350 new/tire).  About 33.5 inch tires<br/>
- LineX bedliner<br/>
- Weather tech mats front and back<br/>
- JBL Sound System and Navigation<br/>
- 3M protective tape<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the truck is just about flawless.  There are no major dents, scratches, or scrapes whatsoever on the truck. No tears, rips, stains, marks, nothing on the interior.  All buttons, gauges, etc.. work as new.  I have taken meticulous care of this truck since I purchased it from the previous owner about 1 year ago.  I wash the truck about once per week and have done all scheduled maintenance.  The 30k service was just completed and everything is running as expected.  I have not made any modifications to the engine at all.  I am only considering selling because I may be driving a lot more and may need a Diesel, but I do not need to sell.  I will not take any lowball offers, if it doesnt sell I am perfectly fine keeping her.  Non smoker, No Kids, Seat covers used front and back.<br/>
<br/>
The top end KBB value is almost $34K as this truck is in excellent condition and with the investment in Bilsteins, Tires, NFab, and Diamondback cover I feel that $35k is a fair price.  Finding a truck like this at a dealer would be very tough, let alone any fees, etc.. you would have to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Asking $35K, if you are wanting to negotiate lower I may consider a slightly lower price but it will most likely not include the Diamondback HD truck bed cover.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for looking, much appreciated.<br/>

</div>
Selling my 1988 Toyota 4runner SR5 4x4. Its been my daily driver for years. Great car but I got something newer and cant justify owning two cars. This 4runner has the 3.0L V6. It would make a great base for and offroad dream machine. The 3.0L V6 shares the same motor mounts and transmission mounts as the later 3.4L V6 and swaps are simple. This car lived in southern California and Arizona before coming up to Colorado so it has really minimal rust for a 30 year old truck.<br/>
<br/>
Good:<br/>
New drums, rotors, master cylinder, rear slave cylinders, LSPV<br/>
New alternator + battery<br/>
New water pump<br/>
<br/>
The bad:<br/>
Despite rebuilding the brake system I cant get the brake pedal firm. Brakes work fine but there is more travel than I would like. Probably an easy fix but I don't have the time to resolve the issue<br/>
Damage on front drivers side. Just cosmetic.<br/>
<br/>
Ill include an extra sets of wheels, factory service manual and cargo box.<br/>
<br/>
I'm available nights and weekends. Email or leave a message and I'll get back to you.    </section></p>

1996 Toyota Tacoma, 4x4, Regular Cab, 5-speed, 3.4L V6<br/>
240,000 miles and 22 years old, but this truck is a beast! With the aftermarket intake and exhaust, the engine runs like a champ and has lots of life left. Very off road capable and drives great on-road as well. Lots of low-end power, good mpg's, very clean (9 out of 10 outside, 8 out of 10 inside).  There is a topper to go with it, but it's not in as good of condition as the truck is.<br/>
<br/>
Old Man Emu lift kit, Doug Thorley Headers (sounds like a V-8), Injen cold air intake (better than K&amp;N), throttle body spacer, Hankook Dynapro AT tires with lots of life left, Hi-flow catalytic converter and cat-back exhaust, flex fan kit, tinted windows, Alpine stereo, clutch-start cancel, speedo/odometer replaced at 195,000 miles (currently reads 45,000), cruise control works, heater works, no A/C<br/>
<br/>
All aftermarket parts professionally installed at ATLR (Affordable Toyota and Lexus Repair)<br/>
<br/>
Please text or email. Thanks for looking!<br/>

I am selling my 2004 Tacoma, it's in good condition and everything runs well. I am the second owner with a majority of the miles highway miles. Two door with an xtracab additional two small seats with seatbelts in the back. Truck has a 6 foot bed with high topper, clean car and upholstery. <br/>
<br/>
Up Side<br/>
- Clean title<br/>
- New tires<br/>
- New Spark Plugs<br/>
- Regular maintenance (oil and transmission)<br/>
- Remote Starter for the winter<br/>
- TRD off-road and towing package<br/>
<br/>
Rough Side<br/>
- Hail damage to the hood mostly (Golden, CO 2017)<br/>
- crack in windshield<br/>
<br/>
The truck has been great for me over the years. I lived in it for a 1.5 years. Since this was my home I was very persistent on keeping up with the care and maintenance of this truck - if my truck broke down then so would my home. This truck was loved, cared for and taken on many adventures. I am selling it because I have moved into a van and dont have the need for another vehicle. <br/>
<br/>
$8,500 is my starting price (book price) and what I'd like to get for it, however I am willing to negotiate depending on how much interest there is.<br/>

I'm the second owner, bought it in '07 w/25k miles.  It is very well maintained, including all scheduled services and garage kept.  It's been a fantastic truck.  If you know Toyotas, you know what I'm talking about.  If you don't, then you need to experience.  All service done by The Toy Shop in Denver, which works exclusively on Toyota/Lexus.  They've told me I'm "in the top 10%" of people who maintain their vehicles.  This motor is known to get 400k miles before it starts using oil.  I'm only selling it because I upgraded to a new Tundra (quality is no match for the '05).  Fresh front end alignment, tires rotated and professional detail.  You'll have a hard time finding a cleaner, better conditioned truck with half the miles.  Must see to believe.  All receipts included.<br/>
